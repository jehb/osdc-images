# Images

This is a collection of images that I have created for use as lead images on Opensource.com. All images are released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) license unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Our lead image size is 520x292 on Opensource.com. If you need a different size for any of these images, please refer to the original source and reprocess as appropriate. The GIMP (.xcf) files may be useful to you, but I'm not making any promises.
